/* The Cameras tile on Live: the robot's own cameras (front, left, right, back), one at a time (§13).
   Loaded after ops.js and uses its helpers (h, fill, postJSON, getJSON, state, dot, toast).

   What opening it does, in this order: ask the controller to switch the cameras on (smart_vision_control, which needs
   Control on), ask the panel for the camera's join details (POST /api/video/token), load Agora's Web SDK from this
   panel (web/vendor/, never a CDN), then join the robot's channel as an audience member and play uid 1's video.
   The video goes from Agora's network to this browser; none of it passes through the panel.

   Rules this file keeps (tests/test_cameras_js.py checks the ones a test can):
   - It never switches the cameras off: state 0 would also cut the official app's view (docs/dev/protocol.md).
   - While the tile is open (connecting, waiting, playing) it asks the panel for one keep-awake beat every 4 s
     (POST /api/video/keepalive). The robot streams only while someone keeps it awake, as the official app does. The
     timer belongs to the start's ticket and camerasLeave() clears it, so every way of stopping stops the beats; the
     panel itself never repeats a beat, so a closed tab stops them too. A press of play opens a window of at most
     15 min on the panel; when the panel ends it, the tile closes.
   - Video runs only while the tile is open and the tab is showing Live. Closing it, changing camera, leaving Live,
     hiding the tab and closing the page all leave the channel.
   - The token, key and salt live in local variables of one function call. They are not kept on `cams`, in the DOM, in
     storage or the URL, and nothing here writes to the console. The stream's secret is longer than Agora's Web SDK
     can wrap (see camerasSwapInstall), so for the client's lifetime it is written into the SDK's join messages to
     Agora in its place. (The SDK keeps a few `websdk_ng_*` items of its own in this panel's localStorage: a device
     id, a cache of its settings and of a preload. This file clears them when the SDK has loaded and when the channel
     is left; none of them holds the token, key or salt.)
   - Agora's SDK is told, before any client exists, not to send usage statistics, not to upload logs, not to fetch
     remote configuration (which could switch the two back on mid-session), not to preload the access point or
     preconnect, and to use a random device id. See camerasQuietSdk. */

// - In those, only a JSON message with the secret field is rewritten (camerasSwapBody), and nothing else in it.
// - It lives as long as the client, not only for join(): when the SDK's signalling reconnects it sends join_v3 again,
//   built from the same stored placeholder, and asks the access point again. camerasLeave() removes it, and installing
//   a new one removes any old one first, so a left client's secret never goes into another start's messages.
