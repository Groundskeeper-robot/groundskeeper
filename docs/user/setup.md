# Setting up
<!-- order: 1 -->

[Settings → Set up](#settings/setup) walks through these steps in order. It opens by itself on a fresh install
(no robot address or no map yet), and each step is the same controls as its own Settings section, so you can also
skip the guide and work through the list below. A tick means the panel already has what the step needs; nothing
is stored for the guide itself. The page updates by itself while something is on its way (the robot connecting, the
cloud signing in, the imagery loading), so there is no need to reload.

Before any of this, the first visit sets the admin password. It needs the setup code from the panel's log
(`docker logs groundskeeper`); see [Signing in](#help/settings).

1. **Robot** ([Robot](#settings/robot)): **Find it on my network** looks for a Yarbo announcing itself on your
   network (it only listens; nothing is sent to anything it finds) and offers **Use this**. Or type its address and
   press **Connect**: the panel checks for the robot's heartbeat, then saves. The serial is read from the robot; the
   port and a typed serial are under Advanced. Then the map is read on its own.
2. **Yarbo cloud** (optional, [Robot](#settings/robot)): only for sending commands and writing the map. You type
   your own password; it goes to Yarbo's SDK and is never stored. Signing in usually takes under a minute.
3. **Map imagery** ([Map imagery](#settings/imagery)), in two parts. *Pick the photo:* your yard's location comes
   from the robot's map, so only the sources that cover it are asked, sharpest first. *Line it up:* **Align on the
   map** opens the map to match a spot on the robot's map with the same spot in the photo; saving brings you back.
   See [Map imagery](#help/imagery).
4. **Cameras** (optional, [Cameras](#settings/cameras)): with Frigate, switch on the cameras that see the yard and
   draw what each covers.
5. **Home Assistant** (optional, [Home Assistant](#settings/ha)): the address and a long-lived token, then the
   presence entity, picked from a list. If the panel runs in Docker, use HA's IP address: `.local` names often do
   not resolve there.
6. **Weather** ([Lawn conditions](#settings/lawn)): a Tempest on your network is heard with no setup; Home
   Assistant sensors are picked from lists matched to each input.
7. **Safety** ([Safety](#settings/safety), [Run rules](#settings/rules)): the four switches, changeable right there:
   control and map writing (each switched on by typing ENABLE), yard must be clear, and resume after a guard pause.
   The recommended values are control off, map writing off, yard must be clear on and no resume; "Use the
   recommended" sets all four and sends nothing to the robot. See [Safety](#help/safety).
8. **Notifications** ([Notifications](#settings/alerts)): an HA notify service or a webhook, then send a test.
9. **AI assistant** (optional, [AI assistant](#settings/assistant)): a token so an assistant can read the panel and
   help by conversation. See [AI assistants](#help/mcp).
