# Map imagery
<!-- order: 85 -->

The aerial photo under the robot's map. Set in [Settings → Map imagery](#settings/imagery).

- **One card per source that covers your yard**, each with its own sample of the yard, resolution, licence and
  season, sharpest first. Pick one, or leave it on **Automatic** (the sharpest free source with real imagery there).
- **Keyed services** (Esri, Mapbox, MapTiler, and some national ones) are contacted only after you save a key.
- **The whole catalog** (its own section, with a Browse button) lists every bundled source by country and then by
  state or province, with search and filters, without contacting any. Search a state by name or code (**Texas** or
  **TX**) to see everything that serves it: its own state, county and city sources, then the national and worldwide
  ones that cover it.
- **Add a source:** paste a map service address; the panel works out what it is, then **Try it at your yard**.
- **Align:** Align on the map (in this section). Pick a spot on the robot's map, then the same spot in the photo. One pair
  fixes the shift; two or more fix rotation; three or more fix scale too.

## How sharp is sharp?

The number on every card (and in the corner of each sample) is how much ground one pixel covers. **Smaller is
sharper.** People rarely have a feel for the unit, so:

| Per pixel | What you can make out | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 7–10 cm (0.25 ft) | Single pavers, sprinkler heads, the mower itself; a crisp lawn edge | Very sharp: county GIS flights, some state programmes |
| 15–20 cm (0.5 ft) | Beds, paths and the lawn edge are clear | Sharp: fine for drawing no-go zones |
| 25–30 cm (1 ft) | Edges go soft; you can still place a zone to within a step | Good enough |
| 50–60 cm | A lawn edge is one blurry pixel; you recognise the yard, not much more | Coarse: USGS NAIP and most national programmes |
| 1 m and up | Whole beds blur together | Too coarse: look for a better source |

Where the detail is: **county and state GIS services** are usually the sharpest free imagery there is, at 7–15 cm,
where the national programmes stop at 30–60 cm. The catalog bundles many of them; **Browse the catalog** shows
every source's sharpest figure. **Keyed services** (Esri, Mapbox, MapTiler) can be sharper than the free ones at
your yard once you add a key. And sharpest is not always best: a leaf-off (spring) flight shows the ground under
trees that a summer one hides, so look at the samples, not just the numbers.

## Getting the most detailed map

1. Open [Settings → Map imagery](#settings/imagery). The cards are sharpest first; the badge says how sharp each is.
2. Click a sample to enlarge it. Compare the two or three sharpest: clear beats slightly sharper but cloudy.
3. Sharpest free source 30 cm or coarser? Add a key to a worldwide service, or find your county or state's own
   service and paste it under **Add a source**. [Finding imagery for a new place](#help/imagery-finding) says where
   to look and what the numbers mean.
4. Easiest of all: connect an [AI assistant](#help/mcp) and ask it to *find the most detailed aerial map of my yard*.
   It compares every source, looks at the samples, searches your region's public services for a sharper one and
   gives you the address to paste in. Your location never leaves the panel.

## Privacy

The panel only contacts sources whose coverage contains your yard. Probing every source would send your home
location to all of them.
