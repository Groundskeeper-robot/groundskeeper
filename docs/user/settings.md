# Settings
<!-- order: 80 -->

One section at a time. The dot next to each section says whether it is set up. Changes apply at once and need no
restart; a field left blank goes back to the environment's value, shown as the placeholder.

| Section | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [Set up](#settings/setup) | The first-run guide: every step below in order, with what each is for ([more](#help/setup)) |
| [Robot](#settings/robot) | Find the robot on your network or type its address; port and serial; the Yarbo cloud sign-in; the Wi-Fi survey |
| [Safety](#settings/safety) | The control and map writing switches ([more](#help/safety)) |
| [Run rules](#settings/rules) | What must be true to start, and what each guard does during a run |
| [Lawn conditions](#settings/lawn) | Weather from the Tempest and/or Home Assistant, soil moisture, units, the dry / damp / wet rules and the last 24 h |
| [Cameras](#settings/cameras) | Frigate: which cameras see the yard, and the ground each covers |
| [Map imagery](#settings/imagery) | The aerial photo under the map ([more](#help/imagery)) |
| [Home Assistant](#settings/ha) | Address and token, presence, the entities the panel publishes |
| [Notifications](#settings/alerts) | The HA notify service and/or a webhook |
| [AI assistant](#settings/assistant) | Optional: a token and connect snippets so an assistant can read the panel and help by conversation ([more](#help/mcp)) |
| [Access](#settings/access) | The admin password, signing out, and API tokens for programs such as Home Assistant |
| [This panel](#settings/panel) | Polling, retention, version, data directory, API, theme |
| [Raw data](#settings/data) | Every field the robot and the panel report |

## A suggested order

Robot first (nothing works without it). Then Map imagery, Cameras, Lawn conditions, Run rules, Notifications, and
Safety last, when you are ready to let the panel act on the robot. An [AI assistant](#settings/assistant) is
optional at any point: once connected it can read every setting and the help, and is good at finding the most
detailed aerial map of your yard.

## Signing in

The panel asks for a password before it shows anything. The first time you open it, it asks for a **setup code**
together with the password you choose. The code is printed in the panel's log (`docker logs groundskeeper`), so
someone else on your network cannot claim the panel before you do. Sessions last 30 days.

- **Change password** (Settings → Access) signs out every other browser.
- **API tokens** are for programs, such as a Home Assistant integration or a script. They send
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and are held to the same safety checks as the pages. A token is shown once, and
  it cannot change the password or make more tokens. AI assistants use their own token, set in
  [AI assistant](#settings/assistant).
- **Forgot the password?** Run `docker exec groundskeeper python -m app.auth reset` and restart the container.
  This also removes every session and API token. The log then shows a new setup code.
- **Behind a reverse proxy** (for https or a hostname): set `PANEL_URL` to the address people open, so changes
  from the pages are accepted. Also set `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` to the proxy's address, so the limit on wrong
  passwords counts each visitor rather than the proxy as a whole.
- **Other web apps on the same host:** browsers send the panel's sign-in cookie to every port of that host. If you
  run apps there that you don't trust, give the panel its own hostname.
- `/health` stays open for Docker and uptime checks. It reports the version, whether the robot is reachable and
  whether it is busy mowing.
- **Proxy that signs people in itself?** `PANEL_AUTH=off` turns the panel's own sign-in off. Never
  do this when anyone else on the network can reach the panel: it would let them start the robot.

## Wi-Fi survey

**When to use it.** It is off unless you turn it on, and most yards never need it. Turn it on when the robot loses
its link in parts of the yard: "No data from Yarbo" during runs, gaps in the track, or weak-positioning spots that
[Problem areas](#help/live) blame on the link (HaLow at −77 dBm or weaker, corrections late). It maps which of your
Wi-Fi networks the robot can hear, and how well, across the whole yard. That shows where the signal fades, where an
access point or a mesh node would help, and whether a network the robot has joined reaches the weak spots at all.
Run it once with **Next run only**, look at Signal → Wi-Fi, and switch it off again unless you are tracking a change
(say, a new access point). It only reads: the robot is never asked to join or leave a network.

**How it works.** Settings → Robot → **Wi-Fi survey**. While a run is driving, the panel asks the robot every 30 s which Wi-Fi
networks it hears, and stores each one's signal where the robot was; the Signal map's **Wi-Fi** shows it. It does not
ask while the robot is parked mid-plan, and with the survey off nothing is kept. Each ask makes the robot scan for
about 4 seconds, so **Next run only** comes first: it surveys one run, writes a report to [Events](#events) (answers,
how long they took, and pauses in the robot's messages during a scan and otherwise), then switches itself off. An
answer that takes more than 12 seconds is counted but not put on the map: the robot has moved on by then.
**Every run** keeps it on. A run with under 10 minutes of driving does not count as the test. Survey data older than
90 days is deleted.

## Yarbo cloud sign-in

You type your Yarbo password in Settings → Robot. It goes straight to Yarbo's own SDK and is never stored or
logged; only the session is kept on the server. It is optional: the panel reads and commands the robot over your
network, and uses the cloud only as a fallback when the robot can't be reached there (Settings → Robot → Route to
the robot shows which way each goes).
