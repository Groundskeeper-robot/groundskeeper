# Decisions

Architecture decision records (ADRs): **why** Groundskeeper is the way it is. Each record is one decision, its
context and what follows from it. How things work now is described in [`../design.md`](../design.md) and
[`../architecture.md`](../architecture.md); this folder keeps the reasons, so a later change can see what it would
undo.

## When a change needs one

Write an ADR in the same PR (or before it, for a decision that comes first) when the change:

- adds, removes or loosens a **safety rule**: an interlock, a guard, a default, who may send what, or a rule in
  `tests/test_guards.py`;
- changes **how the panel reaches the robot**: a route, a transport, or a class of command it may send;
- is **hard to reverse**: a storage format people's databases depend on, a dependency or licence, removing a
  feature;
- **overrides** an earlier ADR. Agree that in the issue first.

Most PRs need none: a fix, a new read, a UI change, a setting with a safe default. When unsure, ask in the issue.

## Rules

- **Never edit an accepted ADR's decision.** To change a decision, write a new ADR and mark the old one
  `Superseded by NNNN`. Fixing a typo or a broken link is fine.
- **Proposed** means agreed in principle and not built yet; it becomes **Accepted** in the PR that builds it.
- Name the code or test that enforces the decision, so a reader can check it still holds without trusting the prose.
- Keep it short: a page at most. No real robot data, dates of runs or readings (the privacy rules in `AGENTS.md`).
- Number in order, four digits, and add a line to the index below. `tests/test_decisions.py` checks the format and
  the index.

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN. Title in a few words

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by NNNN | Rejected
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Links:** #issue, #PR

## Context
What forces the decision: the robot's behaviour, a constraint, what went wrong.

## Decision
What we do, in a few sentences.

## Consequences
What follows, good and bad, and what would make us revisit it.

## Enforced by
The code and tests that hold the decision in place.
```
