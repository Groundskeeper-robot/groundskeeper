# Security

Groundskeeper can start a robot with spinning blades and stores the location of a home. Please report security
problems privately, not in a public issue.

**How:** use [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/Groundskeeper-robot/groundskeeper/security/advisories/new) on the
repository's Security tab. You'll get an answer within a week. Please give us a reasonable time to ship a fix before
you publish details.

**In scope:**
- Getting past sign-in or reading data without it.
- Making the robot move, or changing the map or settings, without the panel's own checks.
- Leaking the yard's location, the robot's serial, or the Yarbo cloud session.
- Server-side request forgery through imagery discovery or integrations.

**Not in scope:** running with `PANEL_AUTH=off` on a network others can reach. That turns sign-in off on purpose.
Also the robot's own local MQTT broker, which accepts commands from any device on its network without a password:
that is the robot's behaviour, not the panel's. Keep the robot on its own network (an IoT VLAN) that only the
panel's host can reach.
Problems in Yarbo's own robot, app or cloud should go to Yarbo.

Supported versions: the latest release. Fixes are not backported.
