"""Writing a Map Studio draft to the robot (spec §7.4).

Only commands captured from the Yarbo app in session C2 (2026-10-01) are used, with the payloads the app sent:
save_nogozone / del_nogozone, save_pathway / del_pathway, save_mower_pathway_params and upload_cloud_map_backup.
The robot assigns ids itself and returns the saved feature in its reply.

* Changing an existing no-go zone or pathway is sent as "add the new one, then delete the old one" (the app needs
  the robot moved to edit a shape in place, so that command is not known). Nothing refers to their ids.
* Areas are changed IN PLACE with `save_clean_area` carrying the area's id (captured 2026-10-07: the app's rename;
  docs/dev/map-writes.md). The live record is read (`read_all_clean_area`), only `range` and
  `name` change, and the id stays, so plans, pathway links and the area's mow settings stay attached. The safety
  copy is LOCAL (decided 2026-10-07: the robot has only 10 backup slots; robot backups are taken only on request):
  the map and the full area records are stored as a "prewrite" version before anything is sent, and every map
  version stays restorable from Map Studio → History. Adding or deleting an area is not offered: both change ids
  (plans and settings are keyed by them), so they stay in the app.
* No-vision zones are changed IN PLACE with `save_novisionzone` carrying the zone's id and its whole record (range,
  ref, name, id, enable, by_pass_level), as the app sent it on 2026-10-10 (capture app-edit-1791655059): switching one
  on or off, reshaping and renaming. The robot answers with the saved zone. A new zone is the same command with
  "id": -1 (the robot assigns one) and `del_novisionzone` {id} deletes one (app, 2026-10-10 22:29, captures 221-235).
  Adding one always needs the explicit OK (the robot ignores its cameras there). Obstacle bypass (by_pass_level) is
  shown, not changed, until the app's modes are matched (0, 1 and 3 seen).
* Plans are saved with `save_plan` {id, areaIds, name, enable_self_order}, as the app sent it on 2026-10-10 (capture
  app-edit-1791687834, a new plan): the app picks the id itself, the next one up. Editing one sends the same command
  with its id (app-edit-1791688547: a rename). `del_plan` {id} deletes one (same capture). See write_plan() and
  delete_plan().
* Dead ends are written like pathways (add; change = add the new, delete the old; delete) with `save_deadend` /
  `del_deadend`, as the app sent them on 2026-10-11 (capture app-edit-1791752041). A dead end's own settings
  (`read_deadend_params` / `save_deadend_params`) are carried over to its replacement when they were ever set (a dead
  end never configured reads back as id 0, the robot's defaults) and edited with write_deadend_params().
* Sidewalks and fences cannot be written (commands not captured); those changes stay in the draft.
* Adds go first and deletes last, so a failure part-way never leaves the yard without a zone.
* After the last command the map is read back and compared with the draft. Any failure or mismatch undoes
  everything that was sent (delete what was added, re-add what was deleted).
