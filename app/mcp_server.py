"""MCP server: the panel for AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, any MCP client), at /mcp (streamable HTTP).

Off until someone creates a token in Settings → AI assistant; every request then needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
Only the token's SHA-256 is stored.

Tools come in three tiers, and every one goes through the same code as the UI (the REST handlers, called in-process,
or the Controller), so validation, interlocks and the audit log are the same:
  - read: status, runs, conditions, schedule, maintenance, events, settings, imagery, help pages;
  - setup: imagery choice among catalog sources, keys, alignment; polling; run rules (tighter only); yard cameras
    Frigate knows (add only); the HA notify service; schedule windows; maintenance. Each needs confirm=true and says
    what it would do without it. The assistant sets confirm itself, so it is a prompt to ask the user, not proof that
    they agreed: anything that could loosen safety, blind a check or send the yard somewhere new is not offered.
  - control: start a plan, pause, resume, stop, return to dock. Needs a third switch, "Assistant commands"
    (Settings → Safety, off by default), on top of the control switch and every interlock. An assistant can never
    override a check, and for its start and resume an unknown counts as a fail (control.check, actor "mcp").
Never exposed: the safety switches, guard auto-resume, loosening any run rule, auto-start windows, the robot, Frigate,
Home Assistant and weather connections, the presence entity, camera coverage, the webhook, trying or saving a new
imagery source (that sends the yard: a person does it in Settings), map writes, robot backups, the cloud sign-in,
manual drive.

In-process calls may only reach the (method, path) pairs in ROUTES, and every id a tool puts in a path must match
SAFE_ID, so no argument can steer a call to another endpoint.

Privacy: results lose keys that hold places or identities (PRIVATE_KEYS), lists of numbers that look like coordinates,
and, in text, everything of a URL after its host, long decimals, serial numbers and email addresses. So an assistant cannot pass the home location on to a web
search or another service. Imagery tools describe the yard by the regions of the catalog outlines that contain it.

INSTRUCTIONS = """This is a self-hosted panel for one Yarbo robot mower: it records the robot, maps its runs and can
control it under interlocks. Use the read tools freely. Setup tools change the panel's own settings: tell the user
what you are about to change and call them with confirm=true only after they agree. Control tools move a robot with
spinning blades: only when the user asks for that specific command. Never try to get around a refusal.

Privacy: never put the user's address or coordinates into a web search, a map viewer or any other service. To find
aerial imagery, use imagery_where (it names the region, e.g. a state or country), then search the web by region,
following the help page imagery-finding. A new imagery address is checked with imagery_discover (no location is
sent); then give the user the address to add in Settings → Map imagery, where trying it at the yard is theirs.

Finding the most detailed map of the yard (the thing users ask for most):
  1. imagery_sources: every source that covers the yard, with native_m (metres of ground per pixel; smaller is
     sharper) and whether its yard sample found real imagery. Read the scale to the user in cm, not metres:
     0.076 m = 7.6 cm (very sharp: pavers, sprinkler heads, the mower), 0.15 m = 15 cm (sharp: beds and edges clear),
     0.3 m = 30 cm (soft edges, still usable), 0.6 m = 60 cm (USGS NAIP: a lawn edge is one blurry pixel),
     1 m+ (too coarse to draw zones on). ArcGIS services quote feet: 0.25 ft = 7.6 cm, 0.5 ft = 15 cm, 1 ft = 30 cm.
  2. imagery_sample on the two or three sharpest with ok samples: a blank, cloudy, or leaf-on sample loses to a
     slightly coarser clear one. Say which you looked at and what you saw.
  3. If the sharpest usable free source is coarser than about 30 cm, search by region (imagery_where) for a county
     or state orthoimagery ImageServer / WMS, which is often 7–15 cm; check candidates with imagery_discover and hand
     the user the address for Settings → Map imagery → Add a source. Keyed worldwide services (Esri, Mapbox, MapTiler)
     are another route: the user adds a key in Settings, then imagery_sources shows their sample too.
  4. Offer imagery_use (confirm after the user agrees) for the best one, or leave Automatic on if it already picked
     it. Mention imagery_align if the photo and the robot's map look shifted.

To set the panel up with the user, follow setup_status: its steps are in order, each says whether it is done and
what is missing, and the help page setup explains each one. Steps that connect the robot, the cloud, Frigate or
Home Assistant are the user's to do in Settings → Set up; guide them there.

Start with status and the help pages (help_pages, help_page) to learn the panel."""
