"""Robot control (spec §10). The only module that can command the robot, and it is OFF until switched on.

Every request passes, in order:
1. the catalogue (five official run commands; anything else, including manual drive, is refused),
2. the master switch (setting `control_enabled`, default False),
3. the interlocks for that command (§10.3), enforced here and not only in the UI,
then goes out through app.link.RobotLink (the robot's local broker first, the Yarbo cloud as a fallback) and is
written to the audit log with its route and result, whatever happened. The robot accepts run commands on its local
broker with no handshake (§10.2, proved 2026-10-21).

The robot sends no reply to run commands (seen 2026-10-05: nothing for start_plan or pause on either broker), so a
command is confirmed by the robot's state changing the way the command should change it (CONFIRM below).
