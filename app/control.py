"""Robot control (spec §10). The only module that can command the robot, and it is OFF until switched on.

Every request passes, in order:
1. the catalogue (five official run commands, the cameras-on switch and the keep-awake; anything else, including
   manual drive, is refused),
2. the master switch (setting `control_enabled`, default False),
3. the interlocks for that command (§10.3), enforced here and not only in the UI,
then goes out through app.link.RobotLink (the Yarbo cloud, the only route to the robot) and is written to the audit
log with its route and result, whatever happened.

The robot sends no reply to run commands (seen 2026-10-05: nothing for start_plan or pause on either broker), so a
command is confirmed by the robot's state changing the way the command should change it (CONFIRM below).
