"""The one way messages go to the robot: Yarbo's cloud broker (app/cloud.py), as the official app's do.

The robot's own broker on the home network was a second route until firmware V3.14.4x closed it (#91); the panel
now has no local route at all. RobotLink stays the single doorway so every send is checked, marked and counted in one
place:

Entry points: `read()` takes only the read requests (commands.READ_ONLY_COMMANDS); `command()` takes only the run
commands (control.CATALOGUE) and only Controller calls it; `write_command()` takes only the captured writes
(mapwrite.WRITE_COMMANDS) and only MapWriter calls it. Nothing else reaches CloudTransport.publish
(tests/test_guards.py). cmd_vel is refused everywhere. Every send is recorded through `mark_sent`, so the robot
echoing it back is never taken for someone else's command.
