"""Which way each message goes to the robot: its own broker on the home network (local) or Yarbo's cloud.

Local first, the cloud as a fallback, so either path alone is enough:
- the robot drops to 4G (unreachable on the home network) when its HaLow link is weak, and the cloud still reaches it;
- a firmware update could close the local broker (it disconnects), or keep it open but ignore commands, and the cloud
  still works;
- the cloud can be down or signed out, and the local broker still works.

Reads go local while the local broker is connected and answering; after LOCAL_MISSES unanswered cheap reads in a row
they go through the cloud for BACKOFF_S, then local is tried again. Run commands go local while it is connected,
unless LOCAL_MISSES local commands in a row were not seen in the robot's state (a broker that accepts but ignores
them): then they go through the cloud for BACKOFF_S. Controller decides when a command may be repeated by the other
route (only pause, stop and return to dock). Map and settings writes keep one route for the whole write and, until a
local write is proved (LOCAL_WRITES_PROVED), go only through the cloud.

Entry points: `command()` takes only the run commands (control.CATALOGUE) and only Controller calls it;
`write_command()` takes only the captured writes (mapwrite.WRITE_COMMANDS) and only MapWriter calls it. Nothing else
reaches LocalTransport.command or CloudTransport.publish (tests/test_guards.py). cmd_vel is refused on every route.
Every send is recorded through `mark_sent`, so the robot echoing it back is never taken for someone else's command.
