"""The recorder: listens to the robot, keeps the latest state, writes telemetry, runs, map versions and events.

Polling policy (read requests only):
* community_yarbo and the phone app already ask for get_device_msg often; their replies arrive on
  data_feedback and we consume them passively.
* We only ask ourselves when the latest full snapshot is older than POLL_IDLE_S (or POLL_ACTIVE_S during a run).
* Map, plans, GPS reference and low-confidence config are read on start and every MAP_REFRESH_S.
* Wi-Fi survey (Settings → Robot, off by default): get_wifi_list every WIFI_POLL_S while a run is moving. It is a
  ~4 s scan on the robot, so "next" (one run, then off by itself) comes first, to check the link stays healthy while
  it scans.
