"""Why the robot cannot run, in one set of words: what is wrong and what fixes it.

Every place that explains a start that would be refused, a schedule window that was skipped, a run that stopped
early or a robot that paused itself turns its raw cause into Reasons here, so Live, Schedule, a run's page, Events
and notifications all say the same thing. A Reason is a plain dict (it goes straight into JSON):
  {code, title, fix, detail, link, severity: "block" | "warn" | "info", source}
