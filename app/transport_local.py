"""Client for the robot's on-board MQTT broker on the home network.

`request()` publishes only the read requests in READ_ONLY_COMMANDS; anything else raises ReadOnlyViolation before the
network is touched. `command()` publishes only what the panel may send to the robot: the run commands in
control.CATALOGUE and the captured writes in mapwrite.WRITE_COMMANDS, never cmd_vel. It is called only by
app.link.RobotLink, which only Controller and MapWriter call, after their own checks (tests/test_guards.py).
Since 2026-10-21 the robot is known to accept action and run commands here (docs/dev/protocol.md → Access control).
