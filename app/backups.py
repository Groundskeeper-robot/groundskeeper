"""The robot's own map backups: save one now, delete, restore (2026-10-07).

Commands, all captured from the Yarbo app on this robot (docs/dev/map-writes.md):
* list     get_all_map_backup {}                                   -> [{id, name, timestamp, is_auto_backup}]
* save     save_map_backup_and_get_all_map_backup_nameandid {}     -> the new list ("Manually Saved N")
* delete   del_map_backup {"ids": [id]}                            -> "Map backup has been successfully deleted."
* restore  map_recovery {"id": id}                                 -> "The map has been successfully restored."
* rename   rename_map_backup {"id": id, "name": "..."}             (captured 2026-10-10, app-edit-1791688836)
Robot backups are made only when asked
(the robot keeps 10); the panel's own copies are local and unlimited.

A restore replaces the whole map AND deletes every plan and resets every area's mow settings (seen 2026-10-07; area
ids come back as they were in the backup). So restore():
1. refuses unless it can read everything the restore wipes: the plan list and every area's settings (by id);
2. keeps the map, plans and settings locally ("prerestore" version);
3. sends map_recovery; from here on nothing raises - each phase records what it did or why it could not;
4. polls the map until it matches the backup (the robot may apply it a moment later);
5. only when it matches: puts each area's settings back where the backup has the SAME id (and the record on the
   robot is the backup's shape), using the app's sequence: save_mower_area_params, then save_clean_area unchanged;
6. makes the wiped plans again (save_plan, same id, name and areas, so schedule windows still point at them) when
   the map is confirmed and the backup has all of a plan's areas, reads the plans back, lists any it could not make,
   uploads the cloud copy and stores the result (map_last_restore).

Robot backups carry a second copy of every pathway and sidewalk: same name and points, fresh ids, other start/end ids
(seen in backups 4322 from 10-01 and 4354 from 10-07, both taken of a 6-pathway map; 14 pathways in each). The live
map after a restore has one of each (an app restore of 4331 at 09:31), so dedupe() drops the copies before any compare.
