"""An area's mowing settings: read_mower_area_params {id} / save_mower_area_params (2026-10-08).

Captured from the Yarbo app (docs/dev/map-writes.md, capture 2026-10-07 09:34): the save carries the
full record as a read returns it, minus clean_times_dis, current_blade_height and move2area_offset_count, with
mapping_module_type: null; the app then saves the area itself, unchanged (save_clean_area), and uploads the cloud copy.
An area whose settings were never saved reads back with id 0: the robot's defaults.

Editable here: only fields whose meaning and unit were matched to the app (the changes in that capture: edge laps 4,
edge offset 1 in, no-go buffer 4 in, speed 0.7 m/s, mowing angle 20 then 30) and the trimmer switch. The rest is shown
read-only. Blade height stays read-only until a second pair from the app pins its scale (25 shows as 3.2 in; that is
the only pair known).

A write reads the settings fresh, saves the full record with the changes, saves the area unchanged as the app does,
reads the settings back and compares every field; if the robot kept something else, the previous settings go back.
The pathway links are checked after the area save (the robot re-links pathways on every area save)."""
