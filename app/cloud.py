"""Yarbo cloud transport (spec §5.3), designed against the bug that broke the official HA integration in June.

* The panel never stores the password. login() hands it to the official SDK, which RSA-encrypts it for Yarbo's API;
  only the session tokens are kept, in DATA_DIR/cloud_session.json (chmod 600).
* The rotated refresh token is persisted after EVERY refresh.
* A failed refresh means "needs login": reconnecting stops, and the panel says so. It never connects with an
  expired JWT (the SDK swallows that failure; this module does not).
* Reconnects back off from 5 s to 5 min.
* One worker at a time. Each has its own stop event; a stopped worker that is still winding down (a connect can take
  20 s) never installs its connection or writes the status, so a sign-in or restart starts the next one at once.
* With no serial known (the robot's local broker is closed, nothing set in Settings → Robot), the account's own robot
  list (the SDK's get_devices(), an account lookup that sends the robot nothing) fills it: one robot is used, several
  are offered in Settings → Robot. While it waits the status says so, and the log says so once.

The SDK is used for its config, auth and per-robot broker routing; the MQTT connection is our own paho client, so
the reconnect/refresh behaviour above is ours too.
