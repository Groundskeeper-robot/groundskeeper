# Third-party notices

The panel's own code is
[MIT](https://github.com/Groundskeeper-robot/groundskeeper/blob/main/LICENSE) (a full link, as this file sits
beside no `LICENSE` in the Docker image). The image also carries these libraries in `web/vendor/`, fetched at
build time by the `Dockerfile` (pinned, checksummed) and never loaded from a CDN at runtime. They are not stored in git.

| Library | Version | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| MapLibre GL JS | 4.7.1 | BSD-3-Clause |
| three.js | 0.170.0 | MIT |
| Agora Web SDK NG (`agora-rtc-sdk-ng`) | 4.24.9 | MIT |

## Agora Web SDK NG

`web/vendor/AgoraRTC_N-production.js` is Agora's unmodified UMD build. It is used under the MIT licence, as the npm
package declares (`"license": "MIT"` in the `package.json` of `agora-rtc-sdk-ng@4.24.9`, the artifact we ship).
The root of Agora's GitHub repository ([AgoraIO/agora-rtc-web](https://github.com/AgoraIO/agora-rtc-web)) shows
Apache-2.0; we follow the package's own declaration. Agora also has a separate proprietary SDK agreement, and the
package ships no LICENSE file; we have asked Agora to add one
([agora-rtc-web#14](https://github.com/AgoraIO/agora-rtc-web/issues/14)).

The package states no copyright holder in `package.json` and has no LICENSE file, but the bundle's own header reads
`AgoraWebSDK_N-v4.24.9-0-g2319458dd Copyright AgoraInc.`, so the line below uses that attribution (the package's
`author` field is "Agora WebRTC Team"). The bundle also contains small third-party modules (for example core-js) that
carry their own notices inside the file.
This file is copied into the image beside the SDK, as `web/vendor/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
